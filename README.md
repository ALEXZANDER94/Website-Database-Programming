# Website-Database-Programming
All of my senior project website-database programs


WEBSITE-DATABASE-PROGRAMMING

I worked on this collection of files for my Senior Project. My role for this project was database administrator. I worked extensively in HTML, PHP, Javascript, and MySQL to connect to the project database. This collection of files contain the essential code required for our website/project to connect to our database to accomodate the needs of the User. This included INSERT into the database, ALTER the User's current 'profile', as well as DELETE if the User no longer wished to be a part of the project. All of these commands were carefully implemented and debugged by myself. I had even implemented Database Security including prepared statements, hashing, field sanitation, and User Authentication via Email.


PREREQUISITES

There are no prerequisites for installing this project.


INSTALLING

To install, clone the project onto your desktop, or wherever you wish to have it stored. 
Then, start by executing the "index.html" which will take the user to the home page of the website my group and I created.


RUNTIME

The webpage we created is designed to be a portal to a web-based RPG my group and I created. The game runs primarily in javascript. Unfortunately, I was unable to implement a connection to the database to display certain attributes of the User's profile.


TOOLS

CPanel - used to develop and admin the database
Arvixe - the web host used for the group domain
p5 - the javascript framework used for game development
